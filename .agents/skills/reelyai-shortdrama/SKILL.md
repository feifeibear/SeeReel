# ReelyAI Short Drama

## Product stance

Treat ReelyAI as an Agent-native short-drama production workstation, not just a web video tool.

- The agent is the creative producer and operator: discuss story, cast characters, plan scenes, generate assets, import references, publish media, submit Seedance tasks, retry failures, and stitch the final cut.
- The web app is the review and human takeover surface: it displays scripts, beats, shots, prompts, assets, sketches, renders, status, and final videos; the user can edit or run any step manually.
- Intermediate artifacts must stay inspectable in the app. Prefer saving state through the local API over one-off files that the UI cannot see.
- API-first rule: when ReelyAI has an endpoint or persisted state field for a step, use it instead of private shell/file operations. Do not bypass graph semantics by manually stitching, patching final files, or writing hidden local artifacts unless recovering from a failure; if recovery is unavoidable, immediately bring the artifact back through ReelyAI API/state (for example `shot.videoUrl`, `renders`, `session.stitchShotIds`, `stitchJobs[].shotIds`, `referenceVideoFromShotId`, `firstFrameAssetId`, `assetIds`, and `finalVideoUrl`) so the human can inspect and take over.

## Standard flow

1. Ensure the app is running.
   - Development: `npm run dev`
   - Production preview: `NODE_ENV=production PORT=5174 npm run start`
   - On this host, use Node 22 in `PATH` if build/dev has Rollup native module issues.
2. Create or select a session. A short drama is one session.
   - **When the user starts from a reference video, do NOT bare-create with `POST /api/sessions` and hand-append shots.** Use the built-in reference-video analysis workflow: `POST /api/assets/upload-video` → `POST /api/assets/:assetId/analyze-video` to populate `asset.parsedShots`, then in the Flow canvas apply parsed entries onto session shots from the reference-video Inspector. The same asset can also be bound as `referenceVideoAssetId` when the user wants Seedance to follow the clip's motion/framing as a licensed or self-owned reference.
   - Bare `POST /api/sessions` is only the right entry when the user is starting from a written premise/script with no reference video.
3. Work with the user in chat to shape the premise, characters, tone, shot count, and duration.
   - **Default cadence: prefer fewer, longer shots.** A 60s short drama defaults to **4 shots × 15s** (Seedance 2.0 supports up to 15s per generation). Long shots make character + scene consistency easier and reduce cut-induced drift. Only break a shot into shorter segments when the action genuinely demands a hard cut (e.g. POV change, time jump, location change).
   - Inside each long shot, plan a beat timeline (`0-3s … / 3-7s … / 7-12s … / 12-15s …`). Pass that timeline through to the Seedance prompt so the model paces correctly. The companion `seedance-prompt-craft` skill has the full 6-element template.
4. Save the story plan and shots through app APIs or existing scripts so the web app reflects the work.
5. Generate or import reference images.
   - Use Codex imagegen when available for high-quality storyboards or character/scene references.
   - For cinematic storyboard contact sheets, follow the companion `reelyai-storyboard-imagegen` skill.
   - Import images into shot sketches with `POST /api/shots/:shotId/sketches/import`.
   - **Storyboard-as-reference (preferred for long shots):** generate a per-shot 2×2 storyboard image whose four panels encode the in-shot beats (`0-3s / 3-7s / 7-12s / 12-15s`), and attach it as a regular `reference_image` (NOT as `firstFrameAssetId`). The new `POST /api/shots/:shotId/storyboard-ref` route handles this end-to-end with VLM iteration. First-frame mode is mutually exclusive with reference_image attachments — only use first-frame when you genuinely need a locked opening composition (e.g. a single-character close-up).
   - Keep sketches shot-scoped unless the user explicitly wants a reusable global asset.
6. Publish local references before video generation.
   - Remote Seedance cannot consume local `/media/...` URLs.
   - Use `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/storyboards/publish-tos` or the web button "故事板 TOS".
   - If using private TOS buckets, leave `TOS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` empty so ReelyAI stores pre-signed URLs.
   - Seedream-4.5 generations come back with public TOS https URLs already; storyboard-ref images created via the new route do not need a separate publish-tos step.
7. Generate shots serially unless the user explicitly asks for parallel generation.
   - For continuity, let shot N+1 wait until shot N is ready.
   - Preserve "参考上一个分镜" semantics: use the full previous shot by default unless the user overrides duration; cap to the previous shot duration.
8. Stitch after every required shot is `ready`.
   - Use `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/stitch`.
   - Preserve stitch wiring through `session.stitchShotIds` or stitch-job `shotIds`; final videos should be produced by `/stitch` whenever possible, not by manual `ffmpeg` outside the app.
   - If stitching fails while downloading remote video, retry stitch before regenerating shots.
9. Return the local final video path and browser URL.

## Human takeover rules

- If the user edits prompt, duration, assets, or first-frame settings in the web app, treat that as source of truth.
- Do not overwrite manual edits unless the user asks for regeneration or a specific replacement.
- Use the UI as a review surface: after large changes, tell the user what they can inspect in the browser.

## Reference image rules

- Only send remote `http(s)` media URLs to Seedance.
- Treat expired TOS/Ark signed URLs as broken references. If a referenced asset returns `403` or times out, republish it or remove it from `assetIds` and keep the description in text.
- Codex imagegen storyboards should usually be compressed before ToS publish when Seedance fetches time out.
- Keep `first_frame` mode separate from generic `reference_image` mode. Do not mix first-frame/last-frame payloads with generic reference media in the same request.

## Reference-video remake (Seedance `reference_video`)

ReelyAI lets a shot bind one whole video as Seedance's `reference_video` slot. The model will follow that clip's motion, framing, and pacing while the prompt drives subject and style. Use this for the user's own footage, licensed B-roll, agent-generated test patterns, or a previously-rendered ReelyAI shot you want to reframe — never for third-party copyrighted footage being repurposed via character substitution.

Mode mutual exclusivity (server enforces this in `submitShotGeneration`): reference-video > sub-shot grid > first/last-frame. Setting `referenceVideoAssetId` automatically wins over previous-shot continuity for that shot.

Four steps end-to-end:

1. **Upload the video as an Asset.** Raw bytes, content-type `video/*`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "$BASE/api/assets/upload-video?ownerSessionId=$SID&filename=clip.mp4" \
     -H 'Content-Type: video/mp4' --data-binary @clip.mp4
   ```
   - The endpoint writes locally, then auto-publishes to TOS if `hasTosConfig()` returns true. **The server process must have `TOS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / TOS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / TOS_REGION / TOS_BUCKET` in its environment** — `dotenv/config` loads them from `.env` only if the file is present at server cwd. If the resulting `asset.mediaUrl` starts with `/media/...`, TOS is misconfigured and Seedance won't be able to fetch the file; restart the server with the env loaded.
   - Verify `asset.mediaKind === "video"` and `asset.mediaUrl` is `https://...`.

2. **Bind the asset to a shot:**
   ```bash
   curl -X PATCH "$BASE/api/shots/$SHOT" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{\"referenceVideoAssetId\":\"$ASSET\"}"
   ```
   The Flow Inspector also exposes a per-shot toggle (`src/client/flow/Inspector.tsx`, panel "用作视频参考(Seedance reference_video)").

3. **Generate as usual.** `POST /api/shots/:shotId/generate` — the generate path resolves `useReferenceVideoMode` and passes `mediaUrl` through to Seedance with `role: "reference_video"`. The render snapshot stores `referenceVideoAssetId` so the audit trail is intact.

4. **Stitch when ready.** Standard `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/stitch`.

Verification quick-check after a render lands: pull the render record from `/api/state` and confirm `renders[-1].referenceVideoAssetId` matches the bound asset id. If absent, the shot fell back to a different mode (most common cause: a `firstFrameAssetId` or `subShotStoryboardAssetId` is also set on the same shot, and one of those took precedence).

## Useful API endpoints

- `GET /api/state`
- `POST /api/sessions`
- `PATCH /api/sessions/:sessionId`
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/script/generate`
- `PATCH /api/sessions/:sessionId/script`
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/storyboard`
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/storyboards/publish-tos`
- `POST /api/assets/upload-video` ← raw video bytes; auto-publishes to TOS for `referenceVideoAssetId` use
- `PATCH /api/shots/:shotId` ← whitelist includes graph/audit fields such as `referenceVideoAssetId`, `referenceVideoFromShotId`, `firstFrameAssetId`, `assetIds`, and previous-shot continuity controls
- `POST /api/shots/:shotId/sketches/import`
- `POST /api/shots/:shotId/storyboard-ref` ← per-shot 2×2 plot-beat reference, VLM-iterated, attached as `reference_image`
- `POST /api/shots/:shotId/generate`
- `POST /api/shots/:shotId/poll`
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/stitch`
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/stitch-jobs`
- `PATCH /api/sessions/:sessionId/stitch-jobs/:jobId`
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/stitch/poll`

## Failure handling

- `content[n].image_url timeout/resource download failed`: compress and republish the image to TOS, or remove the expired reference asset and retry.
- `fetch failed` during polling: retry polling the same task; do not submit a duplicate until state proves there is no active task.
- Stitch download failure: retry stitch. The app caches successfully downloaded shot videos and can continue.
- Duration errors: keep each Seedance shot duration within model limits; build longer films from multiple shots.

## Output style

When reporting completion, include:

- session title
- shot readiness summary
- final video local path
- browser URL for the final video
- notable recovery steps, only if they matter for future iterations
